### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m sunil pandey

# I love web technology, it made us connect, We should admire and learn to code and present art degitally.
#My first love and choice is Finance, How money flows, how businesses operates and their ability to expand exponentially excites me.
#I started my full time job of my choice in 2008, ## A DAY TRADER, A job that has the power to make u what you want to be. But this has a cost, ## You will fall, the way you have not expected ever. A trauma that you take on daily basis but at the end if you r there you will have skills. TO LEARN, TO ADOPT, TO CONTROL EMOTIONS.
# When your emotions, you can't handle, are there, you should use technology if possible. 
#Decide with your experiance, let risk management handle your risk and let your algorithms do the trading part, focus on creation that your life needs. 
# Now in the mean time i have added skills to my being.

#  I love these technologies and art and i can work them with confidance.
